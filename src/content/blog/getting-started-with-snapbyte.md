# Getting Started with Snapbyte: From Zero to Lightning Fast

In today's web landscape, performance isn't just a nice-to-haveâ€”it's a necessity. Users expect pages to load instantly, and every millisecond of delay can impact your conversion rates. That's where Snapbyte comes in.

## What is Snapbyte?

Snapbyte is a developer-first file caching and CDN service designed to deliver your assets with lightning speed, without the complexity of traditional CDN solutions. Whether you're serving images, videos, documents, or any other static assets, Snapbyte ensures they reach your users as quickly as possible.

## Why Choose Snapbyte?

Unlike traditional CDN providers that require complex configurations and enterprise-level contracts, Snapbyte is built for modern developers who want:

- **Simple API**: Start delivering files in minutes, not hours
- **Intelligent Optimization**: Automatic image compression and format conversion
- **Global Edge Network**: 150+ edge locations worldwide
- **Developer-Friendly Pricing**: Pay only for what you use, starting free

## Setting Up Your First Project

Getting started with Snapbyte is incredibly straightforward. Let's walk through the process step by step.

### 1. Create Your Account

First, sign up for a free Snapbyte account at [app.snapbyte.com](https://app.snapbyte.com/signup). No credit card required!

### 2. Get Your API Key

Once you're logged in, navigate to your dashboard and copy your API key. You'll need this to authenticate your requests.

### 3. Install the SDK

For this tutorial, we'll use the JavaScript SDK, but Snapbyte supports multiple languages:

```bash
npm install @snapbyte/sdk
```

### 4. Upload Your First File

Here's a simple example of uploading and optimizing an image:

```javascript
import { Snapbyte } from '@snapbyte/sdk';

const snapbyte = new Snapbyte(process.env.SNAPBYTE_API_KEY);

async function uploadImage() {
  try {
    const result = await snapbyte.upload({
      file: './hero-image.jpg',
      optimize: true,
      formats: ['webp', 'avif', 'jpeg'],
      sizes: [400, 800, 1200]
    });
    
    console.log('Upload successful!');
    console.log('URL:', result.url);
    console.log('Optimized variants:', result.variants);
    
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Upload failed:', error);
  }
}

uploadImage();
```

That's it! Your image is now being served from Snapbyte's global edge network with automatic optimization.

## Advanced Features

### Responsive Images

Snapbyte automatically generates multiple sizes and formats of your images, making it easy to serve the perfect variant for each device:

```javascript
const result = await snapbyte.upload({
  file: './product-image.jpg',
  responsive: {
    mobile: { width: 400, quality: 80 },
    tablet: { width: 800, quality: 85 },
    desktop: { width: 1200, quality: 90 }
  }
});

// Use in your HTML
const img = `
  <picture>
    <source srcset="${result.responsive.desktop}" media="(min-width: 1024px)">
    <source srcset="${result.responsive.tablet}" media="(min-width: 768px)">
    <img src="${result.responsive.mobile}" alt="Product image" loading="lazy">
  </picture>
`;
```

### Custom Transformations

Need to apply specific transformations? Snapbyte's got you covered:

```javascript
const result = await snapbyte.upload({
  file: './user-avatar.jpg',
  transformations: [
    { resize: { width: 200, height: 200, fit: 'cover' } },
    { quality: 90 },
    { format: 'webp' }
  ]
});
```

## Performance Benefits

By using Snapbyte, you can expect to see:

- **80% faster load times** compared to serving files from your origin server
- **60% smaller file sizes** through intelligent compression
- **99.9% uptime** with automatic failover

## Real-World Example: E-commerce Site

Let's look at how an e-commerce site might use Snapbyte to optimize their product images:

```javascript
import { Snapbyte } from '@snapbyte/sdk';

const snapbyte = new Snapbyte(process.env.SNAPBYTE_API_KEY);

async function processProductImages(products) {
  const optimizedProducts = await Promise.all(
    products.map(async (product) => {
      const imageResult = await snapbyte.upload({
        file: product.imageUrl,
        optimize: true,
        formats: ['webp', 'avif', 'jpeg'],
        sizes: [300, 600, 1200],
        transformations: [
          { quality: 85 },
          { sharpen: 1.2 }
        ]
      });
      
      return {
        ...product,
        optimizedImage: imageResult.url,
        responsiveImages: imageResult.responsive
      };
    })
  );
  
  return optimizedProducts;
}
```

## Best Practices

Here are some tips to get the most out of Snapbyte:

1. **Use appropriate image formats**: Let Snapbyte handle format selection based on browser support
2. **Leverage lazy loading**: Combine with native lazy loading for optimal performance
3. **Set up proper caching headers**: Snapbyte handles this automatically, but you can customize if needed
4. **Monitor your usage**: Use the dashboard to track performance and optimize costs

## Next Steps

Now that you've got the basics down, here are some areas to explore:

- **Custom Domains**: Set up your own domain for branded URLs
- **Webhooks**: Get notified when processing is complete
- **Analytics**: Monitor performance and usage patterns
- **Team Management**: Collaborate with your team

## Conclusion
